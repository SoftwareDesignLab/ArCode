# SpecMiner #

SpecMiner statically analyzes Java-based projects, extracts their API usage information, and creates an API usage graph for each project (GRAAM). Then, computes all the generated GRAAMs to create a final API usage specification for a specified framework (e.g. JAAS). This graph is called FSpec.
